# Python Notes Repository

Welcome to my Python Notes repository! This repository contains a collection of Python code files created during my learning journey using PyCharm. Each file focuses on specific Python topics and provides code examples to help understand various concepts.

## Topics Covered

- **Hello World Program**: The simplest program to get started.
- **Input Function**: Examples demonstrating how to use the input function to receive user input.
- **String Manipulation**: Operations and methods for handling and manipulating strings.
- **Data Types**: Overview and examples of different Python data types.
- **Variables**: Understanding variable assignment and usage.
- **Operators**: Various operators in Python and their functionalities.
- **Conditional Statements**: Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to control the flow of your program.
- **Control Flow Statements**: Looping constructs like `for` and `while`.
- **Loop Control Statements**: Using `break`, `continue`, and `pass` to control loop execution.
- **Lists**: Working with lists, including operations and methods.
- **Sets**: Using sets for collection manipulation.
- **Tuples**: Immutable sequences and their use cases.
- **Functions**: Defining and using functions, including arguments and return values.
- **Recursion**: Implementing recursive functions.
- **Scope of Variables**: Understanding local and global scopes.
- **Args and Kwargs**: Handling variable-length arguments and keyword arguments.
- **Lambda Functions**: Using lambda expressions for creating anonymous functions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts** (Coming Soon): Exploring OOP principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
